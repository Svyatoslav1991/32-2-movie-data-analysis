# 32-2-movie-data-analysis

Using the data model from task #1, create a JSON document, but now for five different films.
The keys in this JSON database should be the names of the films, and the values should be dictionaries with information about the films.
Load the database into a C++ program for later analysis.
Provide the following functionality: search for an actor by first name (or last name) and display in the console the names of films in which the actor starred and the role he played.

What is being assessed
Validity of the generated JSON document with the movie database. Correct operation of the actor search program.
